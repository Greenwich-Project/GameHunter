      <h2>TOP RATED GAMES THIS WEEK</h2>
      <h5>The most up voted games this week by gamers. 4th Feb, 2021.</h5>

        <h5 ><strong>Minecraft</strong></h5>
      <p>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game. However, there is an achievement system, known as "advancements" in the Java Edition of the game, and "trophies" on the PlayStation ports. Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option for third-person perspective. The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called "blocks"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can "mine" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things. Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic.<a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/" target="_blank">Link to a Game</a></p>

        <h4>Quick Guide on the game</h4>
        <p>1.Landing: after entering a game you will be flying in a plane above the whole map,the direction of where is the plane going can be found by toogling "Map". When you decide to leave the plane and fall to your selected place you have a chance to pop out a parachute which will make your fall much slower and help you guide yourself on the ground more safely, however there comes an issue that other players can shoot at you when falling even though their is most likely to be really bad when flying.</p>
        <br>
        <p>2.Choosing a gun: When landed look for as many boxes as you can, as boxes can contain different guns and cash, which can be helpfull towards buying additional help from shop such as ammo box or armor box. Orange boxes mean that a legendary gun will most likely be located in it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>3.Different strategies: Some players decide to hide as much as possible meaning surviving the longer brings you a closer chance to winning, however most players chooce to play aggressive and shoot everything in their path, based on the gun that you choose which can vary from Sniper, Rifle, SMG, ShotGun will change your playstyle.

        <h4>Recent Updates</h4>
        <p>NEW MAP TEASER: Today, February 11, 2021, players have discovered that in the Warzone Rumble playlist, a mysterious computer, or more specifically the Trials computer from Black Ops Cold War Zombies has appeared inside of Verdansk’s hospital.

        The computer currently has no known function, and merely shows the string “ZAI/Activate_Zombies” to the player when approached. When interacted with, there seems to be no effect.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition to this, players are now coming in contact yet again with static screen overlays while adventuring through the Rebirth Island Warzone map. Morse code can be heard in the background, as well as the sound of marching.</p>
        <br>
        <p>CHEATERS ARE HIT WITH ANOTHER BAN WAVE: Recently, Raven has started communicating more with the Call of Duty community after the recent banning of over 60,000 Warzone cheaters.

This comes after months of community backlash regarding Warzone’s anti-cheat and the game’s overall state and competitive integrity. Cheaters in-game have seemingly gone unpunished for months, and high-tier play has been infested with obvious aimbotters and wallhackers.

The issue has compounded so harshly, it has led to content creators and streamers reaching breaking points. Streamers like NICKMERCS and Symfuhny quit competitive Warzone entirely, and frustrated players like Bobbypoff had meltdowns on stream.</p>
        <br>
        <p>HOW TO REDUCE FILE SIZE: As updates have arrived for the Call of Duty reboot, the game’s already large file size has continued to grow, especially on PC. In order to combat this, mode-specific uninstall options were added in October, which allowed players to select which Modern Warfare modes they want to have installed – to accommodate Warzone’s ever-increasing size.

Now, further changes have been made to reduce the game’s sizable files on your hard drive. Texture Streaming was “developed to reduce the game’s overall package size by removing certain textures rarely used or encountered by players.”

With Warzone set to remain ‘front and center’ for the Call of Duty franchise for a long time to come, there’s a good chance that players will always need room for both the battle royale shooter, and the latest CoD title.          </p>
        <br>
        <p>Instead of having Texture Packs installed, high-resolution textures on Operators and Weapons will now be streamed to your PC’s cache as needed. By streaming textures instead of having them installed, the game’s file size will be reduced.</p>
